After UVA2: Highest redundancy is between Government and Democracy



I need to rethink the deletion of so many variables, no notable differences between groups so far.

I like the UVA2 network, but I feel that too much reduced.

However, the network gets too much complex and redundancy is obvious when we don't do that.

So, we got with UVA2 full solution.
